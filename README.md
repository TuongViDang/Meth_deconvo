# Meth_deconvo
Cell type deconvolution from methylation data. <br>
Using methylation atlas from reference_samples.csv, cell type proportion was identified from bulk methylation result in bulk_samples.csv.<br>
Folder results contains the outputs of running deconvolve.py. <br>
Folder scripts contains:
- bash script to run deconvolve.py (ViDang_meth_deconvo.bash)
- python code as jupyter notebook for downstream analysis (ViDang_downstream_analysis.ipynb)
- Notebook as html file (ViDang_downstream_analysis.html)
